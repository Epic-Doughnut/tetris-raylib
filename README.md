# Tetris Raylib

My implementation of Tetris using the Raylib library for C++

Made by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVYKG_ch4yM&list=PLwR6ZGPvjVOSRywn9VCQ3yrRVruxzzuo9&index=1), with some minor modifications along the way.

My first attempt at making a game in C++, and a nice learning experience. You can play the game yourself by downloading the zip file and launching "tetris-raylib.exe".
